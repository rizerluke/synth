# Luke's synth stuff
A collection of synth patches and Novation Circuit sessions. 

Most of what's here is stuff that I've made for use in [my church](http://proclaimers.com) â€” mainly Hillsong stuff, with some Elevation and Planetshakers in there too. The Circuit has proven to be an interesting tool to use as an alternative to backing tracks, or just to be able to play more parts at once when I'm the only keys player. I'm constantly experimenting and improving so the quality here will be pretty variable. If you happen to stumble across this and find it useful, or if you ahve any suggestions, please get in touch.
